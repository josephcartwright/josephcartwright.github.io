				<h1>My Projects</h1>
				<p>During my time at OU, I have worked on a handful of projects for different purposes. A few noteworthy ones are:</p>
				<div>
					<dl>
						<dt>Database Project</dt>
						<dd>Using Visual Basic and Microsoft Sequel Server, my project group created a database from scratch, emulating the entire process from Entity Diagramming, Implementation, and SQL Queries.</dd>
						
						<dt>Field Project</dt>
						<dd>Our team was tasked with creating an AI powered solution that would scan incoming student emails in a professors inbox using NLP to gahter context, then respond to common and easily answered questions invlolving content from the class syllabus. If the AI was faced with a more complex or unrelated email, it would mark it as unread and flag it as important for the professor to answer themselves. This was aimed to eliminate a large potion of time dedicated by professors to responding to student emails while also organizing important messages.</dd>
